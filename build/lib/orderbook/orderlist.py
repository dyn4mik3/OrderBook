class OrderList(object):
    '''
    A doubly linked list of Orders. Used to iterate through Orders when
    a price match is found. Each OrderList is associated with a single
    price. Since a single price match can have more quantity than a single
    Order, we may need multiple Orders to fullfill a transaction. The
    OrderList makes this easy to do. OrderList is naturally arranged by time.
    Orders at the front of the list have priority.
